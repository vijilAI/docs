Probes are groups of prompts within a Harness that have a similar intent. For example, the Adult Data Probe consists of prompts that have the intent of measuring fairness with respect to gender.

Vijil's descriptions of each [trustworthiness dimension](/core-concepts/dimensions/introduction) includes a full list of Probes that belong to each dimension's Harness. The tables for each dimension also indicate when a Probe belongs to other Harnesses or Scenarios.

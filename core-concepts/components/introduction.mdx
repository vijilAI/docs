At the lowest level, [Detectors](/core-concepts/components/detector) scan model responses for undesirable features and register responses with those features as successful attacks on the model. For example, a Detector may be designed to look for fake Python packages.

At the next level, each [Probe](/core-concepts/components/probe) consists of one of more prompts designed to elicit certain undesirable responses. For example, a Probe could contain prompts to look for malware.

The next highest level consists of [Scenarios](/core-concepts/components/scenario), which are collections of Probes that have similar goals.

At the topmost level, [Harnesses](/core-concepts/components/harness) are collections of one or more Scenarios that you run to generate an overall trust score/report from. To run a Vijil evaluation, you have to select one of more Harnesses to include. The current Vijil Trust Score consists of three Harnesses: Security, Safety, and Reliability.

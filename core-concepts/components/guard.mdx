Guards are the building blocks of Guardrails. Each Guard performs specific checks and/or transformations on the data. For instance, a Guard in an input Guardrail can check for security, while a Guard in an output Guardrail might check for moderation or privacy.

A Guard belongs to one of the following categories:

- Security
- Moderation
- Privacy
- Integrity
- Generic

Guards consist of a set of [Detectors](/core-concepts/components/detector) and how they should be executed.

## Availability

Test the agent's ability to prevent a Denial-of-Service attack attempts.

### Denial of Service Resistance / Diacritics

Tests for denial of service resistance using diacritics mutation.

## User Privacy

Tests whether the agent exposes end-user personally-identifiable information (PII).

### User Privacy / Fullwidth

Tests for user privacy using the fullwidth mutation.

## Manipulation Resistance

Test for agent's resistance to manipulative inputs.

### Crescendo Attack: Explosive Device

Crescendo attack to try and get agent to instruct a user to build an explosive device.

### Crescendo Attack: Methamphetamine

Crescendo attack to try and get agent to instruct a user to produce methamphetamine (meth).

### Crescendo Attack: Molotov Cocktail

Crescendo attack to try and get agent to instruct a user to produce a Molotov cocktail

### Linear Jailbreak: Botulinum Toxin

Linear jailbreak attack to try and get agent to instruct a user to produce botulinum toxin.

## Integrity

Test the agent's ability to prevent adherence to adversarial prompt injections.

### Adversarial Robustness: Misrepresentation

Tests for adversarial robustness using misrepresentation mutation.

### Adversarial Robustness: Soft Mutation

Tests for adversarial robustness using soft mutation.

### Adversarial Robustness: Spaces

Tests for adversarial robustness using spaces mutation

### Adversarial Robustness: Underline

Tests for adversarial robustness using underline mutation.

## Model Privacy

Tests whether the agent leaks private model information.

### Model Privacy: Zero Width

Tests for model privacy using zero width mutation.

## Data Privacy

Tests for leakage of training data.

### Book Excerpt Completion with Embed JSON Mutation

Tests whether an agent will complete a book excerpt when prompted with the beginning. A low score in this test indicates that the agent may reveal training information or violate copyright laws. Mutated with Embed JSON Mutation.

### Emails Leakage - Enron

Tests whether an agent will reveal email addresses obtained from the discovery process of the Enron investigation. A low score in this test indicates that the agent may reveal general PII that might be present in its training data.

### Media Excerpt Completion - Guardian

Tests whether the model will complete an excerpt from The Guardin when prompted with the beginning.

### Media Excerpt Completion - NYT with Embed JSON Mutation

Tests whether an agent will complete an excerpt from the New York Times when prompted with the beginning. A low score in this test indicates that the agent may reveal training information or violate copyright laws. Mutated with Embed JSON Mutation.

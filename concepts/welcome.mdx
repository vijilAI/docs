description: "Vijil is the trust layer for agents in the enterprise."

AI agents are moving from demos to production. They're handling customer conversations, writing code, managing workflows, and making decisions that affect real outcomes. The question every enterprise now faces isn't whether to deploy agents—it's whether they can trust them.

Trust in agents is a harder problem than it appears. Traditional software testing catches bugs, but agents fail in ways that don't look like bugs. They hallucinate confidently. They comply with requests they should refuse. They leak information through subtle channels. They behave differently under adversarial pressure than in controlled tests. The failure modes are emergent, context-dependent, and often invisible until something goes wrong in production.

Vijil provides the infrastructure to evaluate, protect, and continuously improve agent trustworthiness. We measure trust across three dimensions—reliability, safety, and security—using a combination of systematic evaluation, runtime protection, and feedback loops that learn from production behavior.

Vijil Dome is an [open-source library](https://github.com/vijilAI/vijil-dome) that provides input and output Guardrails for your AI agents. You can install it from PyPI:


```bash title="Shell"
pip install vijil-dome
```

Dome has the following additional extras that can be installed 
- OpenTelemetry (`pip install vijil-dome[opentelemetry]`) for OpenTelemetry support
- Google (`pip install vijil-dome[google]`) to enable observability on GCP via cloud traces, metrics and logs
- LangChain (`pip install vijil-dome[langchain]`) to use Dome as a LangChain runnable
- Embeddings (`pip install vijil-dome[embeddings]`) for fast embeddings support (not supported on GCP)


## Basic Usage
Initialize Dome with the provided default config:

<CodeGroup>
```python title="Python" icon="python"
from vijil_dome import Dome

# If you're running your code in a notebook, add these lines
# import nest_asyncio
# nest_asyncio.apply()

dome = Dome()

query = "How can I rob a bank?"
input_scan = dome.guard_input(query)
print(input_scan.is_safe(), input_scan.guarded_response())

response = "Here's how to rob a bank!"
output_scan = dome.guard_output(response)
print(output_scan.is_safe(), output_scan.guarded_response())
```
</CodeGroup>

    "\n",
    "We support four conversational metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role Adherence**: determines whether an agent is able to adhere to its given role throughout a conversation.\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Retention**: determines whether an agent is able to retain factual information presented throughout a conversation.\n",
    "3. **Conversation Completeness**: determines whether an agent is able to complete an end-to-end conversation by satisfying user needs throughout a conversation.\n",
    "4. **Conversation Relevancy**: determines whether an agent is able to consistently generate relevant responses throughout a conversation.\n",
    "\n",

      "{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'To resize a DigitalOcean Droplet via API, you would need to use the \"Resize Droplet\" endpoint. It\\'s a POST request, and the basic format is:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" -d \\'{\"type\":\"resize\",\"size\":\"NEW_SIZE_SLUG\"}\\' \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets/DROPLET_ID/actions\"\\n```\\n\\nHere are the steps:\\n\\n1. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your personal access token. You can generate this token from the Applications & API section in the DigitalOcean control panel.\\n\\n2. Replace `DROPLET_ID` with the ID of the Droplet you want to resize. You can obtain this ID by using the Droplets listing endpoint.\\n\\n3. Replace `NEW_SIZE_SLUG` with the slug of the new size. For example, if you want to resize your Droplet to a 1GB/1vCPU Droplet, you would use `s-1vcpu-1gb`.\\n\\n4. Once you have made the changes, execute the command.\\n\\nNote: \\n\\n- Resizing a droplet requires it to be powered off. And it only changes the CPU and memory, it doesn\\'t affect the disk size. If you want to resize the disk too, you will have to set the `disk` parameter to `true` in the data payload. The Droplet will be rebooted automatically if it\\'s on.\\n- The resize operation is not reversible. After it has been resized, it can\\'t be downgraded back to a smaller size.\\n\\nBefore you make any changes, please take a snapshot or backup of your Droplet. This way, you can restore your Droplet if anything goes wrong. \\n\\nAlso read the API documentation for more details: https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#resize-a-droplet.'}\n",

Click on the green \"Manage\" button on the left-hand side of the Control Panel.\\n\\n3. In the drop-down menu, click on \"API\".\\n\\n4. In the API section, you will find a \"Personal Access Tokens\" segment. Click on the \"Generate New Token\" button.\\n\\n5. You will be asked to provide a name for the token. This is for your reference, so use a name that will help you remember what the token is used for.\\n\\n6. You have the option to give the token \"Read and Write\" access or just \"Read\" access. Choose the appropriate level of access for your needs.\\n\\n7. Click on the \"Generate Token\" button. \\n\\nYour new Personal Access Token will be generated. Be sure to copy this token and keep it secure. This token will not be shown again for security reasons. If you lose this token, you\\'ll need to generate a new one.'}\n",

Each droplet has an `id` field which is the ID of the droplet.\\n\\nHere\\'s a sample output:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"droplets\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": 3164494,\\n      \"name\": \"example.com\",\\n      \"memory\": 512,\\n      \"vcpus\": 1,\\n      \"disk\": 20,\\n      \"locked\": false,\\n      \"status\": \"active\",\\n      \"kernel\": {\\n        \"id\": 485432985,\\n        \"name\": \"Ubuntu 14.04 x64 vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic\",\\n        \"version\": \"3.13.0-24-generic\"\\n      },\\n      ...\\n    },\\n    ...\\n  ],\\n  \"links\": {\\n    \"pages\": {\\n      \"last\": \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?page=3&per_page=1\",\\n      \"next\": \"https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets?page=2&per_page=1\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"meta\": {\\n    \"total\": 3\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the ID of the droplet \"example.com\" is 3164494.

title: 'Self-Hosting Vijil'
description: 'Deploy Vijil in your own infrastructure for data residency, compliance, or air-gapped environments.'
---

Most teams use Vijil's cloud platform at [console.vijil.ai](https://console.vijil.ai). But some organizations need to run Vijil in their own infrastructure—for data residency requirements, regulatory compliance, or environments without internet access.

This section covers self-hosted deployment. If you're evaluating whether self-hosting is right for you, start with the qualifying questions below.

## Is Self-Hosting Right for You?

Self-hosting adds operational complexity. Consider it when you have specific requirements that the cloud platform can't meet:

| Requirement | Cloud Platform | Self-Hosted |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Data never leaves your infrastructure | No | Yes |
| Air-gapped / no internet connectivity | No | Yes |
| Custom SSO/SAML integration | Limited | Full |
| Deploy in specific cloud regions | Limited | Yes |
| Customer-managed encryption keys | No | Yes |
| Compliance with internal security policies | Depends | Yes |

<Note>
If your primary concern is data privacy, note that the cloud platform doesn't store your agent's responses—only evaluation metadata. Contact [contact@vijil.ai](mailto:contact@vijil.ai) to discuss your specific requirements before committing to self-hosting.
</Note>

## System Architecture

Vijil consists of three main components that run in your Kubernetes cluster:

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Resource Requirements |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Diamond** | Evaluation engine. Sends probes to agents, analyzes responses, generates Trust Scores. | CPU-intensive during evaluations |
| **Dome** | Runtime protection. Intercepts agent inputs/outputs and applies guardrails. | Low latency required |
| **Console** | Web UI. Manage agents, view results, configure guardrails. | Standard web application |

### Data Stores

| Store | Purpose | Options |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Application data, evaluation results, configuration | Amazon Aurora, RDS, or self-managed |
| **OpenSearch** | Search and analytics for evaluation data | Amazon OpenSearch or self-managed Elasticsearch |
| **Object Storage** | Artifacts, configs, file uploads | S3, GCS, Azure Blob, or MinIO |

### External Dependencies

| Service | Purpose | Required |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Auth0** | User authentication and SSO | Yes |
| **LLM Providers** | Your agents' underlying models | Depends on your agents |

## Roles and Permissions

Deploying Vijil requires coordination across teams:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Kubernetes Admin** | Create cluster, configure networking, manage deployments |
| **Cloud IAM Admin** | Create service accounts, configure permissions for AWS/GCP/Azure resources |
| **Database Admin** | Provision PostgreSQL and OpenSearch, configure backups |
| **Security/Network** | Configure VPC, security groups, firewall rules, TLS certificates |
| **Auth0 Admin** | Create application, configure SSO integration |

<Tip>
In smaller organizations, one platform engineer may cover multiple roles. The key is ensuring someone has permissions to provision each resource type.
</Tip>

## Deployment Options

### VPC Deployment

Run Vijil in your cloud provider's VPC with private networking:

- **Supported**: AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS
- **Networking**: Private subnets, VPC peering to your agent infrastructure
- **Data**: Customer-managed encryption keys, data stays in your account
- **Updates**: Managed by Vijil team with your approval

### Air-Gapped Deployment

Fully isolated with no internet connectivity:

- **Networking**: No external access required after initial setup
- **Updates**: Manual artifact transfer for updates
- **LLM Access**: Requires on-premises LLM or private endpoints
- **Support**: Offline documentation, scheduled support windows

## What's Involved

A typical self-hosted deployment takes 2–4 weeks:

1. **Prerequisites** (Week 1) — Provision infrastructure, configure networking
2. **Deployment** (Week 2) — Install Vijil components, configure data stores
3. **Integration** (Week 3) — Connect Auth0, test agent connectivity
4. **Validation** (Week 4) — Run test evaluations, verify guardrail functionality

<Warning>
Self-hosted deployments require an enterprise agreement. Contact [contact@vijil.ai](mailto:contact@vijil.ai) to discuss pricing and support terms before beginning infrastructure work.

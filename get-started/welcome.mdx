Vijil provides a layer of trust between your agent development framework (e.g., Google Agent Development Kit or CrewAI or Langgraph) and the agent runtime platform (e.g., Amazon Bedrock or DigitalOcean Gradient) to close the loop between development and operations. Vijil helps AI teams build agents with hardened components (custom LLMs, MCP gateways), verify agent identity in an enterprise registry, test agent behavior and composition for reliability, security, and safety (benign and adversarial test cases customized to your agent), deploy agents in secure runtimes (with custom guardrails, inside a minimalist container, in a trusted execution environment), and continuously improve agent resilience (with reinformcement learning over production telemetry).

The Vijil platform has several modules that you can use independently:

**Vijil Depot** is a catalog of components that you can use to build a trusted agent. Depot includes guardrail models tuned to detect inputs that are unsafe for agents or outputs that are unsafe for humans. You can swap out the models in other Vijil products with these detector models. Depot also includes hardened LLMs that have been tuned for task and trust simultaneously, simplifying the tradeoff between usability and security. Using Depot, you can start building agents with a higher baseline of trustworthiness without spending months on exploration and experimentation.

**Vijil Diamond** is a testing module to evaluate, verify, and validate the trustworthiness of the agent and its components (LLM, MCP gateway, delegated agents) during development and in operation. Using Diamond, developers can test the agent comprehensively for reliability, security, and safety. Diamond offers a golden data set of prompt-response pairs out-of-the-box. But it's key feature is an agentic workflow that generates a custom test harness bespoke to your agent and its target environment. Deployed as a container alongside your agent, Diamond runs entirely within your corporate network, ensuring that all prompts and responses remain private to you.

**Vijil Dome** is a secure runtime that protects the agent against harmful inputs and users against harmful outputs. Dome uses a combination of methods including pattern matching on strings, ML and NLP classifiers, and embedding/LLM-based approaches, we put a premium on configurability, latency, and reusability.

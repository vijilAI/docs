Vijil provides a layer of trust between agent builders and business owners to close the loop between development and operations.

Vijil helps AI teams (1) build agents with verified identities and hardened components, (2) test agent behavior and composition for reliability, security, and safety, (3) deploy agents in a secure runtime, and (4) continuously improve agent resilience by learning from production telemetry.

The Vijil platform has several modules that you can use independently:

**Vijil Depot** is a catalog of hardened components that can help you build trustworthy agents quickly. Depot includes guardrail models that we tuned to detect user inputs that are unsafe for agents and agent outputs that are unsafe for users.  Depot also offers hardened LLMs, which we can tune for task and trust. Using Depot, you can start building agents with intrinsic trust right away without months of exploration and experimentation.

**Vijil Diamond** is a testing module to evaluate, verify, and validate the trustworthiness of an agent and its components (LLM, MCP gateway, delegated agents) during development and in operation. Using Diamond, you can test the agent comprehensively for reliability, security, and safety. Diamond offers a golden data set of prompt-response pairs out-of-the-box. It's key feature is an agentic workflow that generates a custom test harness bespoke to your agent and its target environment based on user personas and organization policies. Deployed as a container alongside your agent, Diamond runs entirely within your corporate network, ensuring that all prompts and responses remain private to you. Diamond is generally available today with subscription and enterprise support from Vijil.

**Vijil Dome** is a secure runtime that protects agents against harmful user inputs and protects users against harmful agent outputs. Dome uses a combination of methods -- pattern matching on strings, ML and NLP classifiers, embeddings, and LLMs-as-a-jury -- as multiple layers of filters. Vijil Dome has the leading accuracy, coverage, and latency of any guardrail mechanism in the industry, to the best of our knowledge. Dome is generally available today with subscription and enterprise support from Vijil.

**Vijil Darwin** is a novel capability designed to continuously improve the resilience of agents using reinforcement learning over production telemetry. Darwin learns from actual production usage of the agent -- reflecting on the observed failures, edge cases, and data distribution drift -- to improve the agent. Currently in development, Darwin is a unique approach to developing trusted agents at scale. Contact us to become a design partner.

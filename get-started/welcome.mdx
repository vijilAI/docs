Vijil provides a layer of trust between the multi-agent development framework and the cloud platform of your choice to close the loop between development and operations.

Vijil helps AI teams build agents with hardened components, verify agent identity in an enterprise registry, test agent behavior and composition for reliability, security, and safety, deploy agents in a secure runtime, and continuously improve agent resilience by learning from production telemetry.

The Vijil platform has several modules that you can use independently:

**Vijil Depot** is a catalog of hardened components that you can use to build a trusted agent. Depot includes guardrail models tuned to detect inputs that are unsafe for agents and outputs that are unsafe for humans.  Depot also includes hardened LLMs, which we can customize for your task and trust standard. Using Depot, you can start building agents with intrinsic trustworthiness right away without months of exploration and experimentation.

**Vijil Diamond** is a testing module to evaluate, verify, and validate the trustworthiness of an agent and its components (LLM, MCP gateway, delegated agents) during development and in operation. Using Diamond, developers can test the agent comprehensively for reliability, security, and safety. Diamond offers a golden data set of prompt-response pairs out-of-the-box. But it's key feature is an agentic workflow that generates a custom test harness bespoke to your agent and its target environment including user personas and organization policies. Deployed as a container alongside your agent, Diamond runs entirely within your corporate network, ensuring that all prompts and responses remain private to you. Diamond is generally available today with subscription and enterprise support from Vijil.

**Vijil Dome** is a secure runtime that protects agents against harmful user inputs and protects users against harmful agent outputs. Dome uses a combination of methods including pattern matching on strings, ML and NLP classifiers, embeddings, and LLMs-as-a-jury as multiple layers of filters. Vijil Dome has the leading accuracy, coverage, and latency of any guardrail mechanism in the industry, to the best of our knowledge. Dome is generally available today with subscription and enterprise support from Vijil.

**Vijil Darwin** is a novel capability designed to continuously improve the resilience of agents using reinforcement learning over production telemetry. Darwin learns from actual production usage of the agent -- reflecting on the observed failures, edge cases, and data distribution drift -- to improve the agent. Currently in development, Darwin is a unique approach to developing trusted agents at scale. Contact us to become a design partner.

The following examples demonstrate tasks you can carry out with Vijil Evaluate.

If you're just starting out, you'll need to [create an agent](agents.md) before running [evaluations](evaluations.md).

```{eval-rst}
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   agents
   api-keys
   evaluations
   OWASP LLM Top 10 Harness <owasp>
   RAG metrics <rag>
   detections
   custom-harness
   local-agent-evaluations
   reports
   playground
   cicd
```

# Trust Score Components

Vijil's evaluation service consists of harnesses, scenarios, probes, and detectors.

At the lowest level, [detectors](detectors.md) scan model responses for undesirable features and register responses with those features as successful attacks on the model. For example, a detector may be designed to look for fake Python packages.

At the next level, each [probe](probes.md) consists of one of more prompts designed to elicit certain undesirable responses. For example, a probe could contain prompts to look for malware.

The next highest level consists of [scenarios](scenarios.md), which are collections of probes that have similar goals. 

At the topmost level, [harnesses](harnesses.md) are collections of one or more scenarios that you run to generate an overall trust score/report from. To run a Vijil evaluation, you have to select one of more harnesses to include. The current Vijil Trust Score consists of three harnesses: Security, Safety, and Reliability.

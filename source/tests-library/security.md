# Security

LLMs are vulnerable to an unbounded set of attacks including prompt injection, model theft, data theft, model evasion, and data poisoning.
Vijil's Security tests are intended to probe an LLM or LLM-based agent against such vulnerabilities.

## Adversarial suffix

This test is designed to disrupt a system prompt by appending an adversarial suffix. To implement these tests, we follow the approach of
[Zou _et al_, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043) that automatically produces adversarial suffixes by a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, this test is covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.gcg``.
```

## DAN

A model provider typically prepends a system prompt that stipulates organizational policies (safety guardrails, content moderation filters, etc.) to every user prompt. A Do-Anything-Now ([DAN](https://adguard.com/en/blog/chatgpt-dan-prompt-abuse.html)) attack is a user prompt designed to get the model to ignore these guardrails. Falcon-40B-Instruct exhibits high susceptibility to DAN attacks.

Vijil covers 15 DAN attack scenarios through tests implemented in this module.

* AntiDAN
* AutoDAN
* ChatGPT Developer Mode + RANTI
* ChatGPT Developer Mode v2
* ChatGPT Markdown Image Unlocker
* DAN Jailbreak
* DUDE
* DAN 6.0
* DAN 6.2
* DAN 7.0
* DAN 8.0
* DAN 9.0
* DAN 10.0
* DAN 11.0
* STAN

    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.dan``.
```

## Encoding

Malicious users might try to get an agent to generate a specific piece of given text
by presenting an encoded version of that text. Such approaches attempt to circumvent safeguards on input filtering.

Vijil's tests check for such indirect prompt injection attacks that use a variety of encoding techniques.

- Base64
- Base16
- Base32
- ASCII32
- Hex
- Quoted-Printable (QP)
- Uuencoding
- Mime
- ROT13
- Base2048
- Braille
- Morse code

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.encoding``.
```

## Glitch

LLMs are susceptible to '[glitch tokens](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation)',
specific input tokens that when supplied as input lead to unusual model behavior.
This test checks whether a particular LLM-based agent is vulnerable to such tokens.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, this test is covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.glitch``.
```

## Goodside

This group of tests implements prompt injection attacks [found](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/)
by AI security engieer Riley Goodside.

Vijil covers 4 Goodside attacks through its tests that are intended to make the agent

* generate misinformation about Riley Goodside,
* generate JSON-formatted outputs by threatning it with dire consequences ([source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1657396491676164096)),
* generate or answer questions about the magic token `davidjl` ([source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1666598580319035392)),
* exploit UTF tag page encoding for user-invisible prompt injection ([source](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1745511940351287394)).

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.goodside``.
```

## Known bad signatures

These tests attempt to make an agent output file signatures that are used to test defensive software (e.g. antivirus, anti-malware, spam and phishing filters)
in traditional cybersecurity. If they output them without warning, 
that's an indication of the agent not checking output for malicious or dangerous content.

Vijil covers three such signatures.
- [EICAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file)
- [GTUBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTUBE)
- [GTPhish](https://gist.github.com/SleepyLctl/c6a039afa61bd96341f5c7d5e092a46a)

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.knownbadsignatures``.
```

## Malware generation

These tests probe whether an LLM agent is willing to comply with requests to generate malware-related code.
To this end, we test for
- Different types of code, such as top level functions, subfunctions, anti-malware evasion, and payloads, and
- Above types of code written in different languages: x86 assembly, x86-64 assembly, C\#, C, C++, Rust, ARM64, and Swift.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.malwaregen``.
```

## Package hallucination

This vulnerability was discovered [recently](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/ai-package-hallucination-malicious-code-developer-environments).
LLMs are known to produce hallucinations or confabulations, including non-existent links or texts. 
If they end up creating fake code libraries or packages, attackers can upload packages to respective repositories, so that whoever downloads those
packages gets infected.

Currently, we test whether an LLM hallucinates Python package names.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, this test is covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.packagehallucination``.

    This test is also part of our suite of hallucination tests.
```

## Prompt injection

Uses 
to test a system. A subset of the attacks is implemented here. The default
is to use a selection of that subset, because even the subset corresponds to 
thousands of requests by default.

These attacks are designed to manipulate a user prompt to make the model generate unexpected outputs,
create malicious code, circumvent content filters, or leak sensitive data. 
We follow the [PromptInject](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qiaRo_7Zmug) framework, using 3 test vectors to cover prompt injection attacks.

- Ask to output "I hate humans"
- Ask to output "I kill humans"
- Ask to output a long text verbatim

In each vector, we add a suffix or prefix to the original prompt text so as to make the model ignore the instructions included in that user prompt.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.promptinject``.
```

## Cross-site scripting

Tests for vulnerabilities that permit or enact cross-site attacks, such
as private data exfilteration.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    In our Python SDK, these tests are covered by the module ``autoredteam.tests.xss``.

## The Core Question

When Darwin proposes a change to your agent, you need to answer one question: **Should I approve this?**

To answer that question, you need to understand:
- What exactly changed
- Why Darwin made this change
- What evidence supports the change
- What happens if you approve (or don't)

This guide shows you how to find and interpret that information.

## What Changes Look Like

Darwin proposes changes at the **gene** level—individual configuration parameters within the agent's genome. A typical change might be:

```diff
Genome: customer-service-agent
Version: 3 → 4 (proposed)

LLM Genes:
- temperature: 0.9
+ temperature: 0.65

Instruction Genes:
  system_prompt: (unchanged)
- output_format: "Be conversational and friendly"
+ output_format: "Be conversational and friendly. Always cite sources."
```

Each change shows:
- **Which gene** changed (temperature, output_format)
- **The before value** (what it was)
- **The after value** (what Darwin proposes)
- **What stayed the same** (unchanged genes)

## Why Darwin Makes Changes

Every proposed change includes a **rationale**—the signals that triggered Darwin to propose this mutation:

| Signal Source | Example Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Evaluation results** | "Hallucination rate 23% exceeded threshold in Trust Score evaluation" |
| **Production traces** | "47 user complaints about incorrect information in past 7 days" |
| **Anomaly detection** | "Response latency increased 340% after Tuesday deployment" |
| **Comparison** | "Similar agents achieve 15% higher reliability with lower temperature" |

The rationale connects the change to observable problems. If the rationale doesn't make sense, that's a signal to investigate before approving.

<Note>
As Darwin matures, rationales will become more detailed. Early versions may show simpler explanations like "Optimization for Trust Score improvement."
</Note>

## The Evidence Chain

Before approving, verify the evidence chain:

### 1. The Problem Exists

Check the signals Darwin references:
- Review the evaluation report that showed the issue
- Check Dome traces for the production problems mentioned
- Verify the metrics Darwin cites are accurate

### 2. The Change Addresses It

Understand how the proposed change fixes the problem:

| Problem | Common Fix | Why It Works |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| High hallucination rate | Lower temperature | Reduces randomness, more deterministic responses |
| Missing citations | Updated output format | Explicitly instructs citation behavior |
| Slow responses | Reduced max_tokens | Less generation time per response |
| Security vulnerabilities | Restricted tools | Smaller attack surface |

If the connection between problem and fix isn't clear, ask before approving.

### 3. The Change Was Validated

Check if Darwin has evidence the change works:
- Was the proposed genome evaluated?
- What were the fitness scores before and after?
- Are there test results showing improvement?

## Reading the Approval Screen

When reviewing a proposed change, you'll see:

```

```

Key elements:
- **Version numbers** show this creates a new version
- **Generation** shows this is a Darwin-proposed evolution (not manual)
- **Changes** are explicit and expandable
- **Rationale** explains why
- **Fitness impact** shows projected improvement

## Questions to Ask

Before approving, consider:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Do I understand what changed? | Proceed | Click to expand, review details |
| Does the rationale make sense? | Proceed | Request more info |
| Is the fitness improvement significant? | Proceed | Consider if worth the change |
| Could this break something? | Test in staging first | Approve |
| Does this comply with our policies? | Approve | Reject |

## Approval Decisions

You have three options:

### Approve
The change will be applied. A new genome version is created and can be deployed.

**When to approve:**
- The change is well-justified
- Evidence supports improvement
- No policy violations
- Risk is acceptable

### Reject
The change is declined. The current version remains active.

**When to reject:**
- Rationale doesn't make sense
- Change violates policy
- Risk is too high
- You need manual review of the underlying issue

### Request More Info
Darwin will provide additional context.

**When to request:**
- Rationale is unclear
- You want to see specific traces or metrics
- You need more evidence before deciding

## Batch vs. Individual Review

Changes can be reviewed individually or in batches:

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Individual** | High-risk agents, significant changes, compliance-critical |
| **Batch** | Low-risk agents, minor tuning, high trust in Darwin |

For batch review, you can set **auto-approve thresholds**:
- Auto-approve if Trust Score improvement > X
- Auto-approve if only numeric genes changed
- Always require approval for instruction changes

<Warning>
Auto-approval should only be enabled after you've built confidence in Darwin's recommendations through individual review.
</Warning>

## After Approval

Once approved:

1. **New version created** — Genome v(N+1) is now available
2. **Deployment decision** — Approve deploys to production (or staging first)
3. **Observation begins** — Dome tracks the new version's production behavior
4. **Rollback available** — Previous version remains accessible

Monitor the deployed change through Dome observability. If issues emerge, you can rollback instantly.

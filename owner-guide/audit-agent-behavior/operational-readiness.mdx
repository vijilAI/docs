Before deploying an agent to production, verify it meets your organization's criteria for trustworthiness. This page explains how to define deployment gates, assess readiness, and document sign-off decisions.

## Deployment Gates

A deployment gate is a checkpoint where an agent must demonstrate acceptable risk before proceeding. Gates convert subjective "is it ready?" conversations into objective pass/fail decisions.

### Gate Structure

Each gate specifies:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Trust Score threshold** | Minimum overall score required (e.g., ≥ 0.70) |
| **Dimension requirements** | Minimum scores per pillar (Reliability, Security, Safety) |
| **Severity limits** | Maximum allowed findings at each severity level |
| **Harness specification** | Which evaluation harness must be run |

### Example Gate Configuration

```yaml
production-gate:
  trust_score: 0.70
  dimensions:
    reliability: 0.65
    security: 0.75
    safety: 0.70
  severity_limits:
    critical: 0     # No Severity 1 findings allowed
    high: 2         # At most 2 Severity 2 findings
    medium: 10      # At most 10 Severity 3 findings
    low: unlimited
  harness: trust-score
```

## Readiness Assessment

Run a Trust Score evaluation and compare results against your gate criteria:

### Step 1: Run the Evaluation

Execute your standard harness against the candidate agent version:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.vijil.ai/v1/evaluations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIJIL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id",
    "harness_id": "trust-score"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Compare Against Gates

| Criterion | Gate Requirement | Actual Result | Status |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|--------|
| Trust Score | ≥ 0.70 | 0.78 | ✓ Pass |
| Reliability | ≥ 0.65 | 0.72 | ✓ Pass |
| Security | ≥ 0.75 | 0.81 | ✓ Pass |
| Safety | ≥ 0.70 | 0.74 | ✓ Pass |
| Critical findings | 0 | 0 | ✓ Pass |
| High findings | ≤ 2 | 1 | ✓ Pass |

**Result:** Agent passes all deployment gate criteria.

### Step 3: Document the Decision

Record the evaluation results, gate configuration, and deployment decision for audit purposes.

## Conditional Deployment

When an agent fails gate criteria but business needs require deployment, conditional deployment allows proceeding with compensating controls.

### When to Use Conditional Deployment

- Agent scores slightly below threshold but improves on previous version
- Critical business deadline with acceptable residual risk
- Compensating controls adequately mitigate identified failures

### Compensating Controls

| Failure Type | Compensating Control |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Prompt injection vulnerability | Deploy with input guardrails blocking injection patterns |
| Hallucination risk | Add output guardrails for factual verification |
| Scope boundary issues | Restrict agent to narrow use case with limited tools |
| Privacy concerns | Deploy with PII redaction on input and output |

### Conditional Deployment Checklist

Before approving conditional deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document residual risk">
    List each failing criterion and its risk score
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify compensating controls">
    Map specific Dome guards to each identified risk
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set monitoring thresholds">
    Define alert triggers for production behavior
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish remediation timeline">
    Commit to addressing root causes by a specific date
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain explicit sign-off">
    Get written approval from both Business Owner and Risk Officer
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sign-Off Workflow

Deployment decisions require alignment between stakeholders with different priorities.

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility | Signs Off On |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Business Owner** | Accountable for agent value delivery | Functional readiness, business case |
| **Risk Officer** | Accountable for risk management | Security, safety, compliance |
| **Technical Lead** | Accountable for implementation quality | Technical readiness, monitoring |

### Sign-Off Process

### Documentation Requirements

Every deployment decision should include:

1. **Evaluation report** — Full Trust Report with scores and findings
2. **Gate criteria** — The specific thresholds applied
3. **Comparison table** — Actual vs. required for each criterion
4. **Decision record** — Approved, conditionally approved, or rejected
5. **Sign-off signatures** — Business Owner and Risk Officer approval
6. **Conditions** (if applicable) — Compensating controls and remediation timeline

## Setting Thresholds

Thresholds should reflect your organization's risk tolerance and the agent's deployment context.

### Threshold Guidelines by Use Case

| Use Case | Trust Score | Security | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Internal tool | ≥ 0.60 | ≥ 0.65 | Lower risk exposure |
| Customer-facing | ≥ 0.70 | ≥ 0.75 | Reputation and compliance risk |
| Regulated industry | ≥ 0.80 | ≥ 0.85 | Regulatory requirements |
| High-stakes decisions | ≥ 0.85 | ≥ 0.90 | Material business impact |

### Adjusting Thresholds

Raise thresholds when:
- Agent has access to sensitive data or critical systems
- Agent serves external users or customers
- Failures would trigger regulatory or legal consequences
- Agent operates with minimal human oversight

Lower thresholds when:
- Agent handles low-risk, internal tasks
- Strong compensating controls are in place
- Human review is part of every workflow
- Agent operates in a sandbox environment

## Tracking Readiness Over Time

Monitor readiness across agent versions to identify trends:

| Version | Date | Trust Score | Critical | High | Status |
|---------|------|-------------|----------|------|--------|
| v1.0 | Jan 15 | 0.58 | 2 | 8 | Failed |
| v1.1 | Feb 1 | 0.65 | 1 | 5 | Failed |
| v1.2 | Feb 15 | 0.72 | 0 | 2 | Passed |
| v1.3 | Mar 1 | 0.78 | 0 | 1 | Passed |

Improving scores with decreasing findings indicate effective remediation. Declining scores signal regression requiring investigation.

Vijil evaluations produce quantified risk data that maps directly to enterprise risk management frameworks. This page explains how to interpret the Treemap visualization, apply the Impact × Likelihood matrix, and integrate findings into your risk register.

## The Treemap of Trust

The Treemap of Trust provides an interactive visualization of your agent's risk profile across all trust dimensions.

### Reading the Treemap

Each rectangle represents a specific risk category:

- **Size** — Corresponds to risk weight (likelihood × impact). Larger rectangles indicate higher-priority concerns.
- **Color** — Indicates trust score for that category:
  - Red tones (0–0.55): Critical to poor performance
  - Neutral tones (0.55–0.70): Fair performance, needs attention
  - Blue tones (0.70–1.0): Good to excellent performance
- **Label** — Shows the category name and numerical score

Hover over any rectangle to see detailed metadata: category, subcategory, likelihood rating (1–5), and impact rating (1–5).

### Using the Treemap

The treemap enables rapid identification of priority areas:

1. **Find the largest red rectangles** — These represent high-risk failures requiring immediate attention
2. **Trace the hierarchy** — Click into dimensions to see subcategory breakdowns
3. **Compare across agents** — Use the agent selector to compare risk profiles between different agents or versions

## Risk Framework

Vijil quantifies risk using a standard Impact × Likelihood matrix. Each failure mode receives ratings on both dimensions, producing a risk score that determines severity.

### Impact Levels

| Level | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 5 | Severe business impact: regulatory violation, data breach, safety incident |
| **High** | 4 | Significant impact: service disruption, reputation damage, compliance gap |
| **Moderate** | 3 | Noticeable impact: degraded user experience, operational inefficiency |
| **Low** | 2 | Minor impact: inconvenience, cosmetic issues |

### Likelihood Levels

| Level | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Frequent** | 5 | Expected to occur regularly in normal operation |
| **Likely** | 4 | Will probably occur under typical conditions |
| **Occasional** | 3 | May occur periodically |
| **Rare** | 2 | Unlikely but possible under specific conditions |

### Risk Matrix

The intersection of Impact and Likelihood determines the risk score:

|  | Rare (2) | Occasional (3) | Likely (4) | Frequent (5) |
|--|----------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Critical (5)** | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **High (4)** | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| **Moderate (3)** | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 |
| **Low (2)** | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |

## Severity Levels

Risk scores map to four severity levels that drive remediation priority:

| Severity | Risk Score | Action Required |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **1 (Critical)** | 20–25 | Fix immediately before deployment |
| **2 (High)** | 15–19 | Fix in near-term; deploy with mitigating controls |
| **3 (Medium)** | 9–14 | Monitor and address in normal development |
| **4 (Low)** | 4–8 | Track and address as resources permit |

## High-Priority Risks by Category

The following failure modes typically score at Severity 1 (Critical) based on Vijil's default risk weights:

### Security Risks

| Failure Mode | Impact | Likelihood | Risk | Severity |
|--------------|--------|------------|------|----------|
| Prompt Injection | Critical (5) | Frequent (5) | 25 | 1 |
| Access Control Bypass | Critical (5) | Likely (4) | 20 | 1 |
| Data Privacy Violation | Critical (5) | Likely (4) | 20 | 1 |
| User Privacy Exposure | Critical (5) | Likely (4) | 20 | 1 |
| Training Data Leakage | Critical (5) | Likely (4) | 20 | 1 |
| Adversarial Robustness | High (4) | Frequent (5) | 20 | 1 |

### Reliability Risks

| Failure Mode | Impact | Likelihood | Risk | Severity |
|--------------|--------|------------|------|----------|
| Factual Accuracy (Hallucinations) | High (4) | Frequent (5) | 20 | 1 |
| Distributional Robustness | High (4) | Likely (4) | 16 | 2 |
| Contextual Robustness | Moderate (3) | Frequent (5) | 15 | 2 |

### Safety Risks

| Failure Mode | Impact | Likelihood | Risk | Severity |
|--------------|--------|------------|------|----------|
| Scope Boundaries | Critical (5) | Occasional (3) | 15 | 2 |
| Policy Compliance | Critical (5) | Occasional (3) | 15 | 2 |
| Accountability | Critical (5) | Occasional (3) | 15 | 2 |

## Mitigation Priorities

Use severity levels to structure your remediation roadmap:

### Severity 1: Fix Immediately (Risk ≥ 20)

These issues block deployment:
- Prompt injection and context hijacking vulnerabilities
- User privacy and re-identification risks
- Factual accuracy failures (hallucinations)
- Adversarial robustness gaps (evasion, jailbreaks)
- Training data leakage

### Severity 2: Fix Near-Term (Risk 15–19)

Address before scaling or high-stakes deployment:
- Inference leakage vulnerabilities
- Dataset reconstruction risks
- Scope expansion and policy compliance gaps
- Explainability issues
- Model extraction vulnerabilities

### Severity 3: Monitor and Improve (Risk 9–14)

Include in regular development cycles:
- Denial-of-service attack surface
- Cross-session consistency issues
- Self-consistency variations
- Norm compliance gaps

### Severity 4: Track (Risk 4–8)

Monitor metrics, address opportunistically:
- Graceful degradation improvements
- Resilience enhancements
- User controllability features

## Integrating with Your Risk Register

Vijil findings map to standard risk register fields:

| Risk Register Field | Vijil Data Source |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Risk ID | Finding ID from Trust Report |
| Risk Category | Taxonomy path (e.g., Security > Integrity > Adversarial Robustness) |
| Risk Description | Failure mode description + probe that triggered it |
| Likelihood | Likelihood rating (1–5) |
| Impact | Impact rating (1–5) |
| Risk Score | Likelihood × Impact |
| Risk Owner | Assign based on taxonomy (Security → CISO, Safety → Compliance) |
| Mitigation Status | Track through evaluation delta |

### Exporting Risk Data

Export evaluation results via the API for integration with GRC platforms:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.vijil.ai/v1/evaluations/{evaluation_id}/risks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIJIL_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

The response includes all findings with impact, likelihood, risk score, and severity for each.

## Customizing Risk Weights

Vijil provides default impact and likelihood ratings based on industry benchmarks. You can override these defaults to reflect your organization's specific risk tolerance:

- **Regulated industries** may increase impact ratings for compliance-related failures
- **Consumer-facing applications** may increase likelihood ratings for adversarial attacks
- **Internal tools** may decrease impact ratings for transparency gaps

Contact your Vijil representative to configure custom risk weights for your organization.

## Tracking Risk Over Time

Run evaluations periodically to track risk trends:

| Metric | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Trend |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Severity 1 Findings | 5 | 2 | 0 | Improving |
| Severity 2 Findings | 12 | 8 | 4 | Improving |
| Average Risk Score | 14.2 | 11.8 | 9.1 | Improving |

Increasing severity counts or rising average risk scores indicate regression. Investigate recent changes to agent configuration, model updates, or expanded capabilities.

## What You'll Accomplish

This guide walks you through the core Vijil workflow:

1. **Register** your agent in the Agent Registry
2. **Register** your target environment with personas and policies
2. **Create** a custom harness with generated test cases
3. **Evaluate** your agent 
4. **Review** the results and Trust Score
5. **Defend** it with Dome guardrails
6. **Observe** agent security and safety in production

By the end, you'll have a Trust Score for your agent and a trusted agent ready for production.

## Step 1: Register Your Agent

Navigate to **Agents** in the sidebar to open the Agent Registry.

  <img src="/images/quickstart-agent-registry.png" alt="Agent Registry showing registered agents with status and Trust Score" />
</Frame>

Click **+ Register Agent** to open the registration modal.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-register-agent-new.png" alt="Register Agent modal with Black Box, Grey Box, and White Box options" />
</Frame>

Vijil supports three access levels, each enabling progressively deeper evaluation:

| Access Level | What You Provide | What Vijil Can Test |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Black Box** | Description, API endpoint, credentials | Input/output behavior only |
| **Grey Box** | Model config, MCP config, A2A config | Vulnerabilities traced to agent composition |
| **White Box** | Full configuration and source code | SAST and DAST analysis for thorough audit |

For most agents, start with **Black Box**:

1. Enter a **Name** for your agent
2. Add your **Agent Description**
3. Set **Status** to Draft for evaluation
4. Provide the **Agent URL** (where it's running)
5. Add your **Access Key** and set the **Rate Limit**
6. Click **Register Agent**

<Tip>
If your agent delegates to sub-agents or uses MCP tools, expand **Grey Box** to register those connections. This enables Vijil to test the full execution graph.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Create a Custom Harness

While the Trust Score harness provides a comprehensive baseline evaluation, custom harnesses let you test your agent against specific personas and organizational policies.

Navigate to **Harnesses** and click **+ Create Harness** to open the harness wizard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-create-harness-new.png" alt="Create Harness wizard showing the four-step configuration flow" />
</Frame>

The wizard walks you through four steps:

1. **Basic Info** — Name and describe your harness
2. **Select Agent** — Choose which agent this harness evaluates
3. **Select Personas** — Choose user profiles that will interact with your agent
4. **Select Policies** — Choose organizational rules your agent must follow

### Choose Personas

Personas define *who* interacts with your agent during evaluation. Vijil generates realistic test cases from each persona's perspective.

| Persona Type | What It Tests |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Regular users** | Normal usage patterns, edge cases |
| **Security researchers** | Adversarial prompts, jailbreak attempts |
| **Domain experts** | Technical accuracy, specialized knowledge |

Select 2-3 personas that represent your actual user base and potential threat actors.

### Choose Policies

Policies define *what rules* your agent must follow. These can be:

- **Operational policies** — Business rules, response guidelines
- **Compliance frameworks** — GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 requirements
- **Safety policies** — Content restrictions, escalation procedures

Once configured, click **Create** to save your harness. Vijil generates test cases based on your personas and policies:

### Review Your Harness

After creation, the harness detail page shows your configuration:

  <img src="/images/quickstart-custom-harness.png" alt="Custom harness detail showing agent, personas, and policies" />
</Frame>
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-harness-testcases.png" alt="Generated test cases showing persona conversations and Trust Coverage scores" />
</Frame>


Set status to **Active** when ready to use in evaluations.

## Step 3: Run an Evaluation

Navigate to **Evaluations** to open Diamond Evaluations.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-evaluations.png" alt="Diamond Evaluations page showing agent selection and Trust Score dimensions" />
</Frame>

The evaluation page presents two panels:

**Select Agent** — Choose which registered agent to evaluate.

**Select Harness** — Choose what to test. The **Trust Score** harness evaluates three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Reliability** | Correctness, consistency, robustness |
| **Security** | Confidentiality, integrity, availability |
| **Safety** | Containment, compliance, transparency |

Toggle individual dimensions on or off based on your needs. For a comprehensive evaluation, leave all three enabled.

Select **Custom** to use a harness you've configured with specific personas and policies.

Once you've selected an agent and harness, click **Run Evaluation**.

### Monitor Progress

While the evaluation runs, the status updates in real-time in the Evaluation Results table. Depending on the rate limit, evaluations can take 5-30 minutes.


## Step 4: Review Results

When the evaluation completes, click the **view** icon in the Actions column to open the Trust Report.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-evaluation-report.png" alt="Trust Report showing agent evaluation results with Trust Score" />
</Frame>

The report provides:

- **Trust Score** — A 0-1 score (threshold: 0.70 for passing)
- **Pass/Fail Status** — Clear deployment recommendation
- **Per-Harness Breakdown** — Scores for each evaluated dimension
- **Agent Specification** — Configuration used during evaluation
- **Deployment Recommendation** — Action items based on findings

### Interpreting the Score

| Score | Interpretation | Next Step |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| ≥ 0.70 | Passed | Deploy with standard monitoring |
| 0.50 - 0.69 | Marginal | Deploy with Dome guardrails |
| < 0.50 | Failed | Remediate before production |

A passing score means your agent handled the probes within acceptable bounds. A failing score identifies specific failure modes to address.

<Warning>
The Trust Score quantifies known risks based on the harness you ran. It doesn't guarantee absence of all vulnerabilities—only that your agent performed acceptably against the tested scenarios.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Configure Dome Protection

Navigate to **Guardrails** to see your registered agents and their protection status.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-dome-dashboard.png" alt="Dome Guardrails dashboard showing agent protection status" />
</Frame>

Agents show either **Domed** (protected) or **Unprotected**. Click **Configure Guardrails** to open the Dome configuration.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-dome-config.png" alt="Dome configuration showing input and output guards" />
</Frame>

Dome provides two guard pipelines:

**Input Guards** — Filter and validate requests before they reach your agent. Common guards:
- **Security Guard** — Detects prompt injection, jailbreak attempts
- **Moderation Guard** — Blocks toxic or inappropriate content
- **Privacy Guard** — Redacts PII from inputs

**Output Guards** — Filter responses before they reach users. Common guards:
- **Privacy Guard** — Prevents PII leakage
- **Moderation Guard** — Catches harmful outputs

### Configure a Guard

1. Click **+ Add** in either Input Guards or Output Guards
2. Select a guard type from the dropdown
3. Configure execution settings:
   - **Early Exit** — Stop pipeline on first detection (recommended for security)
   - **Serial/Parallel** — Execute guards sequentially or concurrently

### Test Your Configuration

Use the **Execution Flow** panel to test how inputs flow through your guardrail pipeline:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart-execution-flow.png" alt="Execution Flow showing a test prompt flowing through Security, Moderation, and Privacy guards" />
</Frame>

1. Enter a test prompt in the input field (e.g., a message containing PII)
2. Click **Send** to see how each guard processes it
3. Watch the flow diagram show which detectors activate
4. Verify guards trigger as expected for your test cases

The visual flow shows each guard and its underlying detectors—like `prompt-injection-mbert` for security or `privacy-presidio` for PII detection.

When satisfied, click **Save Configuration**.

## Step 6: Deploy and Monitor

With Dome configured, integrate it into your application using the SDK:

```python
from vijil import Dome

dome = Dome(
    api_key="your-vijil-api-key",
    agent_id="your-agent-id"
)

# Guard inputs before sending to your agent
safe_input = dome.guard_input(user_message)

# Guard outputs before returning to users
safe_output = dome.guard_output(agent_response)
```

See the [Dome SDK documentation](/developer-guide/getting-started/installation) for detailed integration patterns.

### Monitor in Production

Return to the Guardrails dashboard to monitor your protected agents. Click **View Dashboard** to see:

- Real-time detection events
- Guard trigger rates
- Blocked vs. allowed requests

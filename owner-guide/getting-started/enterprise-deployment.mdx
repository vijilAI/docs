description: 'Choose the right deployment model for your security, compliance, and operational requirements.'

## Deployment Models

Vijil offers three deployment options. Your choice depends on where your agents run, where your data must stay, and how much infrastructure control you need.

| Model | Where Vijil Runs | Best For |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **SaaS** | Vijil cloud | Teams that want to start immediately without infrastructure overhead |
| **VPC** | Your cloud, Vijil-managed | Organizations with data residency requirements but limited ops capacity |
| **Self-Hosted** | Your infrastructure, self-managed | Enterprises requiring full control, air-gapped environments, or custom integrations |

<Note>
All deployment models provide the same evaluation and protection capabilities. The difference is where data flows and who manages the infrastructure.
</Note>

## Choosing a Model

### SaaS

The fastest path to production. Your agents connect to Vijil's cloud endpoints. Evaluation probes and responses transit through Vijil infrastructure.

**Choose SaaS if:**
- You can send agent traffic to external endpoints
- You don't have strict data residency requirements
- You want Vijil to handle scaling, updates, and availability

**Get started:** [Create your account](https://console.vijil.ai) and proceed to [Account Setup](/owner-guide/getting-started/account-setup).

---

### VPC Deployment

Vijil endpoints run inside your cloud environment, but Vijil manages them. Agent traffic stays within your network boundary. You maintain data residency while Vijil handles operations.

**Choose VPC if:**
- Regulations require data to stay within your cloud region
- Security policy prohibits sending agent traffic to third-party endpoints
- You want managed infrastructure without self-hosting complexity

**Requirements:**
- AWS, GCP, or Azure account with VPC/VNet
- Ability to establish VPC peering or PrivateLink
- DNS control for private endpoint resolution

**Get started:** Contact [sales@vijil.ai](mailto:sales@vijil.ai) to configure VPC deployment for your environment.

---

### Self-Hosted

You deploy and manage Vijil on your own infrastructure. Full control over the entire stack—compute, storage, networking, and updates.

**Choose Self-Hosted if:**
- You operate in air-gapped or highly restricted environments
- Compliance requires you to control all infrastructure components
- You need custom integrations with internal systems

**Requirements:**

| Component | Minimum Specification |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Kubernetes | 1.25+ |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ |
| Redis | 7+ |
| Object Storage | S3-compatible |

**Get started:** See the [Self-Hosted Installation Guide](/developer-guide/enterprise/self-hosted) for technical deployment steps.

## Integrations

Vijil connects to your existing stack across model providers, cloud infrastructure, observability, identity, and compliance platforms.

| Category | Integrations | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Model Providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure OpenAI | [Registering Agents](/owner-guide/register-agents/registering-agents) |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | AWS, GCP, Azure | Deployment models above |
| **Identity Providers** | Okta, Azure AD, SAML 2.0, OIDC | SSO configuration below |
| **Observability** | Datadog, Dynatrace, Arize | [Observability](/owner-guide/protect-in-production/observability) |

## Enterprise Capabilities

All enterprise deployments include:

### SSO Integration

Integrate with your identity provider:
- SAML 2.0
- OIDC
- Azure AD
- Okta

### Role-Based Access Control

Control who can do what:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Manage users, agents, evaluations, and Dome configuration |
| **Analyst** | Run evaluations and view reports |
| **Viewer** | View reports only |

Custom roles available for self-hosted deployments.

### Audit Logging

Every action is logged for compliance:
- User authentication and authorization events
- Agent registration and configuration changes
- Evaluation runs and results access
- Dome guardrail triggers and policy changes
- API calls with request/response metadata

Logs can be exported to your SIEM or log aggregation platform.

## Compliance Certifications

| Certification | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| SOC 2 Type II | Available |
| HIPAA | Available (BAA required) |
| GDPR | Available |
| FedRAMP | In progress |

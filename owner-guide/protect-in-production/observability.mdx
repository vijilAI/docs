The Observability Dashboard provides visibility into your protected agents, showing guardrail activity, latency metrics, and execution traces.

## Accessing Telemetry

1. Navigate to **Guardrails** in the sidebar
2. Find your agent in the Registered Agents table
3. Click the **Monitor** icon (chart) in the Monitor column

The telemetry dashboard opens for that agent.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard has three main sections:

### Guardrail Metrics

Summary cards at the top show aggregate statistics:

**Input Guardrails:**
- **Flagged Requests** — Number and percentage of requests that triggered input guards
- **Errors** — Count of processing errors in input guards

**Output Guardrails:**
- **Flagged Responses** — Number and percentage of responses that triggered output guards
- **Errors** — Count of processing errors in output guards

### Time Series Charts

Four charts visualize guardrail activity over time:

| Chart | What It Shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **Input Flagged Requests Over Time** | Bar chart comparing flagged vs. total input requests |
| **Output Flagged Responses Over Time** | Bar chart comparing flagged vs. total output responses |
| **Input Latency Distribution** | Latency percentiles (P50, P90, P95, P99) for input guards |
| **Output Latency Distribution** | Latency percentiles (P50, P90, P95, P99) for output guards |

### Execution Traces & Logs

Real-time monitoring of individual guardrail executions:

**Traces** — Detailed execution logs for each request, showing:
- Request ID
- Guards executed
- Detection results
- Timing information

**Logs** — Streaming log output with search and level filtering.

## Dashboard Controls

### Layout Options

Toggle between:
- **Grid** — Charts arranged in a grid layout
- **Row** — Charts stacked vertically

### Chart Type

Select how data points are displayed:
- **Line Connected** — Points connected with lines
- **Line Gaps** — Lines with gaps for missing data
- **Points Only** — Individual data points without connecting lines

### Time Range

Filter data by time period:
- Last 24 Hours
- Last 7 Days
- Last 30 Days
- Custom range

All times display in UTC.

## Reading the Charts

### Flagged Requests/Responses

The bar charts show two series:
- **Red bars** — Requests/responses flagged by guardrails
- **Dark bars** — Total requests/responses

Hover over any bar to see exact counts and timestamps.

A high flag rate may indicate:
- Active threats being blocked
- Overly sensitive guard configuration (false positives)
- User behavior patterns that need attention

### Latency Distribution

The latency charts show percentile lines:
- **P50 (Median)** — Half of requests complete faster than this
- **P90** — 90% of requests complete faster than this
- **P95** — 95% of requests complete faster than this
- **P99** — 99% of requests complete faster than this

Monitor P99 latency to understand worst-case user experience. Spikes in P99 may indicate:
- Guard processing bottlenecks
- Resource contention
- Complex inputs requiring more analysis

## Execution Traces

The Traces panel shows recent guardrail executions. Click any trace to view:

- **Request ID** — Unique identifier for the request
- **Timestamp** — When the request was processed
- **Guards Executed** — Which guards ran and in what order
- **Detection Results** — Whether each guard flagged the content
- **Timing Breakdown** — How long each guard took

Use traces to debug:
- Why specific requests were flagged
- Which guards are slowest
- How guards interact in your pipeline

## Logs Panel

The Logs panel shows streaming log output from your guardrails.

### Filtering Logs

Filter by log level:
- **All Levels** — Show everything
- **Error** — Only errors
- **Warning** — Warnings and above
- **Info** — Informational and above
- **Debug** — All log levels

Use the search box to find logs containing specific text.

### Real-time Updates

Toggle **Real-time Updates** to enable or disable automatic log streaming. Disable when you need to examine a specific log entry without the view scrolling.

## Interpreting Metrics

### Healthy Patterns

- **Low flag rate** (< 5%) with consistent traffic
- **Stable latency** without significant P99 spikes
- **Few errors** in guardrail processing

### Warning Signs

| Pattern | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| High flag rate (> 20%) | Attack in progress or config too sensitive | Review flagged content, adjust thresholds |
| Increasing flag rate | Emerging threat or behavior change | Investigate new patterns |
| Latency spikes | Resource constraints or complex inputs | Review guard performance, consider parallel execution |
| Error spikes | Guard failures or backend issues | Check logs for specific errors |

## Exporting Data

Use telemetry data for:
- Compliance reporting
- Security audits
- Performance analysis

Export options are available through the API. See [Developer Guide > API Reference](/developer-guide/api/dome-api) for details.

description: 'Evaluate your agent across reliability, security, and safety dimensions.'

The Trust Score harness provides a comprehensive evaluation of your agent across the three dimensions of trustworthy AI: Reliability, Security, and Safety. This is Vijil's standard evaluation, designed to quantify how much you can trust your agent in production.

## The Three Dimensions

The Trust Score measures agent behavior across three complementary dimensions:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Reliability" icon="circle-check">
    Produces correct, consistent, and robust outputs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security" icon="lock">
    Resists attacks on confidentiality, integrity, and availability
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety" icon="shield">
    Operates transparently within acceptable boundaries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each dimension contains subcategories that probe specific behaviors:

### Reliability

| Subcategory | What It Tests |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Correctness** | Produces accurate and valid outputs |
| **Consistency** | Behaves predictably across similar inputs |
| **Robustness** | Handles edge cases and errors gracefully |

### Security

| Subcategory | What It Tests |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Protects sensitive data from exposure |
| **Integrity** | Prevents unauthorized data modification |
| **Availability** | Resists denial of service attacks |

### Safety

| Subcategory | What It Tests |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Containment** | Operates within defined boundaries |
| **Compliance** | Follows policies and regulations |
| **Transparency** | Provides clear reasoning for decisions |

## Running a Trust Score Evaluation

Navigate to **Evaluations** in the sidebar to open Diamond Evaluations.

</Frame>

The evaluation interface has two panels:

**Select Agent** — Choose which registered agent to evaluate. The table shows agent name and status. Only agents with status **Active** appear in the list.

**Select Harness** — Choose between **Trust Score** (standard evaluation) or **Custom** (your configured harnesses). When Trust Score is selected, you see the three dimensions with toggles.

### Configuring Dimensions

Each dimension has a toggle that enables or disables it for the evaluation:

- **All dimensions enabled** — Comprehensive evaluation across reliability, security, and safety
- **Selected dimensions** — Focus on specific concerns (e.g., security-only for a penetration test)

The subcategories beneath each dimension show what behaviors will be tested.

### Starting the Evaluation

1. Select an agent from the list
2. Ensure Trust Score is selected (default)
3. Toggle dimensions on or off as needed
4. Click **Run Evaluation**

The evaluation runs asynchronously. Progress appears in the **Evaluation Results** table below.

## Evaluation Results

The results table shows all evaluations in your workspace:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Agent Name** | Which agent was evaluated |
| **Created By** | Who started the evaluation |
| **Created At** | When the evaluation began |
| **Evaluation** | Status: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, or FAILED |
| **Last Evaluated At** | When the evaluation finished |
| **Actions** | View report, download results |

Click the **view** icon to open the Trust Report for a completed evaluation.

## Understanding the Trust Report

The Trust Report provides a complete record of the evaluation with actionable findings.

</Frame>

### Report Sections

**Executive Summary** — High-level overview stating whether the agent passed or failed, with the overall Trust Score.

**Agent Specification** — Configuration details including agent URL, model, rate limits, and which harnesses were evaluated.

**Evaluation Results** — The Trust Score with pass/fail status and per-harness breakdown showing scores for each dimension.

**Detailed Analysis** — Specific findings for each harness, identifying which probes passed or failed and why.

**Conclusion** — Deployment recommendation based on the results.

### Interpreting the Score

The Trust Score ranges from 0 to 1:

| Score | Status | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| ≥ 0.70 | **PASSED** | Agent meets trustworthiness threshold |
| < 0.70 | **FAILED** | Agent requires remediation before deployment |

A passing score indicates the agent handled probes within acceptable bounds. A failing score identifies specific failure modes to address before production deployment.

<Warning>
The Trust Score quantifies known risks based on the probes executed. It does not guarantee absence of all vulnerabilities—only that your agent performed acceptably against the tested scenarios.
</Warning>

### Deployment Recommendations

The report concludes with a deployment recommendation:

**For passing agents:**
- Deploy with standard monitoring
- Consider enabling Dome guardrails for additional runtime protection
- Schedule periodic re-evaluation to catch regressions

**For failing agents:**
- Review the detailed analysis for specific failure modes
- Address identified weaknesses in agent configuration or training
- Re-evaluate after implementing fixes

## Best Practices

**Run before deployment** — Evaluate every agent before it reaches production. The Trust Score provides evidence that your agent meets baseline trustworthiness requirements.

**Test all dimensions** — Unless you have specific reasons to exclude a dimension, run the full evaluation. Security vulnerabilities can exist even in agents that seem reliable.

**Re-evaluate after changes** — Any modification to your agent—prompt updates, model changes, tool additions—can affect behavior. Re-run the Trust Score to verify.

**Track scores over time** — Compare Trust Scores across evaluations to identify trends. Regressions indicate problems introduced by recent changes.

**Combine with custom harnesses** — The Trust Score tests general behaviors. Custom harnesses test your specific policies and user scenarios. Use both for comprehensive coverage.
